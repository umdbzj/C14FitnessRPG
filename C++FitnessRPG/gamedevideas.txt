My ideas for the Fitness RPG:

Initially, I am thinking this will be a race game between the player and NPCs that represent opponents of various sorts.

The player will be an object with many attributes.  I'm thinking traditional D&D sort of system at the moment, but .....
oh, that could change to be an urban fantasy environment.  GUPS might be a better system.
